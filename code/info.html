              ><strong>"</strong>The basic concept of mob programming is simple:
              the entire team works as a team together on one task at the time.
              <br />That is: one team – one (active) keyboard – one screen
              (projector of course).<strong>"</strong></span

            >
            is when three or more developers are coding together using one
            keyboard only. By programming in a group like this, you enable the
            team to work collaboratively and delivering high quality code.

            identified a few rules to follow when programming in a mob: to have
            a Driver and Navigators. The Driver is in charge of the keyboard and
            the mouse, whilst the Navigators are discussing and going through
            best practice for the solution. The roles should swap and everyone
            should at some point have been both the Driver and the Navigator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mob Programming can also be used for other tasks a developer faces.
            Some examples are: defining requirements, testing or deploying the
            code. You do not have to be all in the same room to work as a mob.
            Working over screenshare works just as well as long as all are
            focusing on the screen of the Driver.
